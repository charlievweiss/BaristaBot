- temp_control - On Arduino 1, reads temp, activates heating coil, sends signal to Arduino 2
- valve_trigger - On Arduino 2, triggers solenoid and water spiral based on signal from Arduino 1
- water_spiral - Initial code for water spiral, will integrate with valve_trigger

- solenoid_onoff_test - simply turns solenoid on and off in loop
- scraps - just... scraps
